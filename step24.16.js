/*Step 16
Now you need to actually sort the array. The first sorting algorithm you will implement is the bubble sort, which starts at the beginning of the array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.

Begin by declaring a bubbleSort variable and assigning it an arrow function that takes an array parameter.*/



const bubbleSort = (array) => {}
