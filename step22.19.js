In the base-2 number system, the rightmost digit represents the ones place, the next digit to the left represents the twos place, then the fours place, then the eights place, and so on. In this system, each digit's place value is two times greater than the digit to its right.

Here are numbers zero to nine in the base-10 and base-2 number systems:

Example Code
| Base-10 | Base-2 |
| ------- | ------ |
|    0    |  0     |
|    1    |  1     |
|    2    |  10    |
|    3    |  11    |
|    4    |  100   |
|    5    |  101   |
|    6    |  110   |
|    7    |  111   |
|    8    |  1000  |
|    9    |  1001  |
Notice that binary numbers are formed from left to right, from the digit with the greatest place value on the left, to the least significant on the right. For example, the number 3 in binary is 11, or 1 in the twos place and 1 in the ones place. Then for the number 4, a digit to represent the fours place is included on the left and set to 1, the twos place is 0, and the ones place is 0.

In your decimalToBinary function, convert the number 10 into binary and return it as a string.*/
