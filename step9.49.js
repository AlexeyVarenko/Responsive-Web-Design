Those look like eyes, but you can still make them better. That's why you created two inner eyes div elements.

Using a class selector, give your .cat-left-inner-eye element a width of 10px and a height of 20px. Also, give it a background color of #fff.*/


.cat-left-inner-eye{
  width: 10px;
  height: 20px;
  background-color: #fff
}
