/*Step 6
You now need to start adding products. Before you do that, you need to consider the structure of your product data. A product will need a unique identifier to distinguish it from other products, a price so people know how much it costs, and a name so people know what they are buying. You should also add a category to each product.

Add an object to your products array. Give this object an id property set to the number 1, a name property set to the string "Vanilla Cupcakes (6 Pack)", a price property set to the number 12.99, and a category property set to the string "Cupcake".*/


const products = [
  {
    id:1,
    name:"Vanilla Cupcakes (6 Pack)",
    price: 12.99,
    category: "Cupcake",
  }
];
