/*Step 48
Before you can begin to build out your locations array, you will first need to learn about objects. Objects are an important data type in JavaScript. The next few steps will be dedicated to learning about them so you will better understand how to apply them in your project.

Objects are non primitive data types that store key-value pairs. Non primitive data types are mutable data types that are not undefined, null, boolean, number, string, or symbol. Mutable means that the data can be changed after it is created.

Here is the basic syntax for an object:

Example Code
{
  key: value
}
You will learn about keys and values in the next few steps.

For now, create a const variable called cat and assign it an empty object {}.

Below that cat variable, add a console.log(cat) statement to see the object in the console.*/



const cat={}
console.log(cat)
