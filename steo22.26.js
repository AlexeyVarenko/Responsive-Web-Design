/*Step 26
Like you saw in the last step, division can lead to a floating point number, or a number with a decimal point. The best way to handle this is to round down to the nearest whole number.

Use the Math.floor() function to round down the quotient of input divided by 2 before it's assigned to quotient.*/


const quotient = Math.floor(input / 2);
