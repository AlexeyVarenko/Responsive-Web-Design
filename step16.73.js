/*Step 73
Now that your "store" and "cave" locations are complete, you can code the actions the player takes at those locations. Inside the buyHealth function, set gold equal to gold minus 10.

For example, here is how you would set num equal to 5 less than num: num = num - 5;.*/



function buyHealth() {
    gold=gold-10
  }
