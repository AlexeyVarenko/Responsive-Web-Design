/*Step 67
As a reminder, it's often best to start with the base case when writing a recursive function so you know what you're working towards, and to prevent an infinite loop.

Similar to your last implementation, you'll divide input by 2 repeatedly until input is 0.

Use an if statement to check if input is equal to 0. If it is, return an empty string.*/



if (input===0){
    return ("")
  }
