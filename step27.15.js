/*Step 15
Classes have a special constructor method, which is called when a new instance of the class is created. The constructor method is a great place to initialize properties of the class. Here is an example of a class with a constructor method:

Example Code
class Computer {
  constructor() {
  }
}
Add an empty constructor method to the ShoppingCart class.*/


class ShoppingCart {
  constructor() {
  }
};
