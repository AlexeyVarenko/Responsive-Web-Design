/*Step 65
Now you should see a countdown from 3 to 0, followed by Reached base case, and a count from 1 to 3. This is because, after the recursive loop is finished, the function will continue to execute the code after the recursive call. This is why you see Reached base case before the count from 1 to 3.

Now that you have a better understanding of how the call stack and recursion work, you'll refactor the decimalToBinary() function to use recursion instead of a while loop.

First, remove your countDownAndUp() function and function call.*/
