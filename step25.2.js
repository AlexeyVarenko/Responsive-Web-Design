/*Step 2
To begin, the calculate function needs to find the number that was entered in the #numbers input field. To do this, use a .querySelector to locate the input field and then use the .value property to get the number entered.

Store this in a value variable.*/



const calculate = () => {
  const value=document.querySelector("#numbers").value;
