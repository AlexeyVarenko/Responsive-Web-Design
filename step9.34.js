/*Step 34
Most cats have different colors in their ear and the inner part of the same ear. You can implement the same too. That's why you defined a div element for both right and left inner ears a while ago.

Using a class selector, give your .cat-left-inner-ear element a left and right border of 20px solid transparent each. Also give it a bottom border of 40px solid #3b3b4f.*/


.cat-left-inner-ear{
    border-left: 20px solid transparent;
    border-right: 20px solid transparent;
    border-bottom: 40px solid #3b3b4f
  }
