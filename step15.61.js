/*Step 61
You should now see the same bunch of characters in your console. Your padRow function is doing the exact same thing you were doing earlier, but now it's in a reusable section of its own.

Use the addition operator to concatenate a blank space " " to the beginning and end of your repeated character string.

Remember that you can use the + operator to concatenate strings like this:

" " + "string"*/



function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
    return  " " +character.repeat(rowNumber)+ " ";
  }
