/*Step 32
There is still more functionality that your ShoppingCart class needs, but first you need to be able to test the code you have currently written. You'll need to instantiate a new ShoppingCart object and assign it to a variable. Here is an example of instantiating the Computer class from earlier examples:

Example Code
const myComputer = new Computer();
Declare a cart variable, and assign it a new ShoppingCart object. Note the use of the new keyword when instantiating the object.*/



const cart = new ShoppingCart();
