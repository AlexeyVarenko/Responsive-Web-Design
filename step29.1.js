/*Step 1
All the HTML and CSS for this project has been provided for you. You can take a look at the two files to familiarize yourself with them.

Start by getting the #author-container and #load-more-btn elements with the .getElementById() method. Assign them to the variables authorContainer and loadMoreBtn, respectively.

The variables will not change, so use const to declare them.*/


const authorContainer=document.getElementById("author-container");
const loadMoreBtn=document.getElementById("load-more-btn");
