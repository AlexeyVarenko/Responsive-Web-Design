/*Step 54
Your locations array will hold different locations like the store, the cave, and the town square. Each location will be represented as an object.

Inside your locations array, add an object. Inside that object add a key called name with a value of "town square".

Remember to follow this syntax:

Example Code
{
  key: value
}*/


const locations = [
    {
      name: "town square"
    }
  ];
