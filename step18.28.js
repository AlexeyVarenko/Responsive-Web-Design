/*Step 28
Now that you have the list of songs displayed on the screen, it would be nice to sort them in alphabetical order by title. You could manually update the allSongs array, but JavaScript has an array method you can use called sort().

The sort() method converts elements of an array into strings and sorts them in place based on their values in the UTF-16 encoding.

Example Code
const names = ["Tom", "Jessica", "Quincy", "Naomi"];
names.sort() // ["Jessica", "Naomi", "Quincy", "Tom"]
Inside your sortSongs function, add the sort() method to userData?.songs.*/



userData?.songs.sort()
