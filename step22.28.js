/*Step 28
Next, you need to calculate the remainder of input divided by 2. You can do this by using the remainder operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. For example:

Example Code
const remainder = 5 % 2; // 1
In other words, the dividend, 5, can be divided by the divisor, 2, multiple times. Then you're left with a remainder of 1.

Inside your while loop, create a variable named remainder and use the remainder operator to assign it the remainder of input divided by 2.*/



const remainder=input%2;
