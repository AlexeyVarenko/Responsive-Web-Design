/*Step 25
To divide numbers in JavaScript, use the division operator (/). For example:

Example Code
const quotient = 5 / 2; // 2.5
In the example above, 5 is the dividend, or the number to be divided, and 2 is the divisor, or the number to divide by. The result, 2.5, is called the quotient.

Inside your while loop, create a variable named quotient and assign it the value of input divided by 2.*/


const quotient = input / 2;
