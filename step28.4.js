/*Step 4
Before you can begin building out the functionality for the game, you will need to set up the ability to add 2D graphics.

The Canvas API can be used to create graphics in games using JavaScript and the HTML canvas element.

You will need to use the getContext method which will provide the context for where the graphics will be rendered.

Example Code
canvas.getContext("2d");
Assign that getContext method to a const variable called ctx.*/



const  ctx=canvas.getContext("2d");
