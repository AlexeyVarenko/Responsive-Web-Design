/*Step 64
Now your update function needs to use the argument you pass into it.

Inside the update function, change the value of the button1.innerText assignment to be location["button text"]. That way, you use bracket notation to get the "button text" property of the location object passed into the function.*/



function update(location) {
    button1.innerText = location["button text"];
    button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
    button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
    button1.onclick = goStore;
    button2.onclick = goCave;
    button3.onclick = fightDragon;
    text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
