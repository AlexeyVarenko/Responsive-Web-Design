A good way to test that everything is working is to log the value attribute of numberInput to the console. As a reminder, you can access the value attribute of an element by using dot or bracket notation.

Within the checkUserInput function, use console.log() to log the value of numberInput to the console.*/


console.log(numberInput.value)
