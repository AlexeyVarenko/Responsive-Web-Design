/*Step 44
You are calling your padRow function, but not doing anything with that function call. All functions in JavaScript return a value, meaning they provide the defined result of calling them for you to use elsewhere.

To see the result of calling your padRow function, declare a call variable and assign your existing padRow call to that variable.*/



const call=padRow();
