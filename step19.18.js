/*Step 18
To format the date into yyyy-mm-dd, you will need to use the split, reverse, and join methods. But first, you will need to go through a few practice examples so you can better understand how to use them in the context of this project.

The split() method is used to divide a string into substrings based on a specified separator. It then returns these substrings as elements of an array.

Here is an example of taking the words "Hello World" and returning an array of one element:

Example Code
const greeting = "Hello World";
greeting.split(); // ["Hello World"]
Create a new const variable called exampleSentence and assign it the result of "selur pmaCedoCeerf".split().

Then add a console statement to log the value of exampleSentence. Open up the console to see the result.*/



const exampleSentence= "selur pmaCedoCeerf".split();
console.log(exampleSentence);
