/*Step 84
Before deleting a song, you need to check if the song is currently playing. If it is, you need to pause the song and play the next song in the playlist.

Use an if statement to check if the userData?.currentSong?.id is equal to the id of the song you want to delete.*/



if (userData?.currentSong?.id===id){
