/*Step 46
You have repetition in the goTown and goStore functions. Repetition in your code is a sign that you need another function.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with function parameters like this:

Example Code
function myFunction(param) {
  console.log(param);
}
Function parameters act as placeholders for values that you pass to the function when you call it.

Create an empty update function that takes a parameter called location.*/



function update(location) {
  
}
