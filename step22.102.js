/*Step 102
For the next phase of the animation you'll update the paragraphs with the msg text. Since you have the delays for each step of the animation already, you can add your code to the same .forEach() loop.

Add another setTimeout() function. Pass in an empty callback function as the first argument, and pass in the showMsgDelay property of the current object as the second argument.*/



setTimeout(function(){}, obj.showMsgDelay)
