/*Step 110
Create a new const variable called checkpointDetectionRules and assign it an empty array.

Inside that array, add a boolean expression that checks if the player's position.x is greater than or equal to the checkpoint's position.x.*/



const checkpointDetectionRules=[
  player.position.x>=checkpoint.position.x
];
  checkpoints.forEach((checkpoint, index, checkpoints) => {
