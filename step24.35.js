/*Step 35
An insertion sort algorithm starts the sort at the beginning of the list, meaning the first element is already sorted. With this in mind, create a for loop that starts at the second element in the array - it should still iterate through the rest of the array.*/



const insertionSort = (array) => {
  for (let i=1; i<array.length; i++){
    
  }
}
