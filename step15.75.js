/*Step 75
The text is gone again! Empty strings evaluate to false, making them a falsy value. You will learn more about truthy and falsy values in future projects.

For now, remove your if statement entirely. Use let to declare a continueLoop variable and assign it the boolean false. Then use let to declare a done variable and assign it the value 0.*/



let continueLoop=false;
let done=0;
