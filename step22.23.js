/*Step 23
For the decimal to binary conversion, you need to divide input by 2 until the quotient, or the result of dividing two numbers, is 0. But since you don't know how many times you need to divide input by 2, you can use a while loop to run a block of code as long as input is greater than 0 and can be divided.

As a reminder, a while loop is used to run a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to true, and the condition is checked before the code block is executed. For example:

Example Code
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
Create a while loop that runs as long as input is greater than 0. Leave the body of the loop empty for now.*/



while (input >0) {
  
}
