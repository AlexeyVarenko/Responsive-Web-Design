/*Step 84
Next, you'll create an object to represent the first frame of your animation. Your object should have two properties or keys: inputVal, and addElDelay.

inputVal will represent the value of the input each time your recursive function runs. And addElDelay will be the delay between adding DOM elements to the page.

Add an object to animationData with an inputVal property set to 5, and an addElDelay property set to 1000.*/



{
    inputVal: 5,
    addElDelay: 1000,
