/*Step 71
Your pyramid has disappeared again. That's okay - that is to be expected.

Before you create your new loop, you need to learn about if statements. An if statement allows you to run a block of code only when a condition is met. They use the following syntax:

if (condition) {
  logic
}
Create an if statement with the boolean true as the condition. In the body, print the string "Condition is true".*/



f (true) {
    console.log("Condition is true") 
   }
