/*Step 106
Now your animation is complete. When you enter 5 in the number input and click the Convert button, the animation will add paragraphs to the DOM, update the text of each paragraph, and then remove the paragraphs from the DOM.

The last thing you need to do is add the result of converting the number 5 into binary to the page once the animation is complete.

After the .forEach() method, add another setTimeout() function. Pass in an empty callback function as the first argument, and a delay of 20000 milliseconds as the second argument.*/a
