/*Step 52
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

Example Code
objectName["property name"];
Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

Example Code
const spaceObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
};

spaceObj["Space Name"]; // "Kirk"
Update your console statement to use bracket notation to access the property "Number of legs" of the cat object.

Open up the console to see the output.*/


console.log(cat["Number of legs"]);
