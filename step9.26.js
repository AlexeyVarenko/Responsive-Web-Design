/*Step 26
To position the left ear properly, you can use CSS transform to rotate it in a certain degree.

The transform property allows you to modify the shape, position, and size of an element without changing the layout or affecting the surrounding elements. It has functions such as translate(), rotate(), scale(), skew(), and matrix().

Set the transform property to rotate(-45deg) and see what happens.*/


transform: rotate(-45deg);
