/*Step 49
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through properties.

Properties consist of a key and a value. The key is the name of the property, and the value is the data stored in the property.

Here is an example of an object with a single property:

Example Code
const obj = {
  name: "Quincy Larson"
};
Inside your cat object, add a new property. The key should be name and the value should be the string "Whiskers".

Open up the console to see the updates to your object.*/



const cat = {
    name:"Whiskers"
   }
