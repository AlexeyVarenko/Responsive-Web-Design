/*Step 56
Now it is time to test out the playNextSong function.

Add a "click" event listener to the nextButton element, then pass in playNextSong as the second argument of your event listener. This is the function the event listener will run.

Test out your app by first clicking on the play button followed by the next button. You should see that everything is working as expected.*/



nextButton.addEventListener("click", playNextSong)
