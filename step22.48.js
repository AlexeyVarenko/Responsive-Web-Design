/*Step 48
When your code runs, the a() function is added to the call stack first.

In your callStack array, add the following string: 'a(): returns "freeCodeCamp " + b()'. This represents the function call and the code that will be executed.

Note: Since the string you're adding includes double quotation marks ("), wrap it in single quotation marks (') or backticks (`).*/



const callStack = [
    'a(): returns "freeCodeCamp " + b()'
    ];
