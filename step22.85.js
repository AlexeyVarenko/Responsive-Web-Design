/*Step 85
Recall that the call stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. This means that, as functions are called, they are added to the top or end of the stack, and as functions return, they are removed from the top of the stack.

Treat your animationData array as a stack and add a new object to it. Your new object should have the properties inputVal, and addElDelay set to 2, and 1500, respectively. Remember to add this object to the top of the stack, or in other words, to the end of the animationData array.*/
