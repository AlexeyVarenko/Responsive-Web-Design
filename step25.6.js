/*Step 6
A user could put any text they want into the input box. You want to make sure that you are only working with numbers. The Number() constructor will return NaN (which stands for "not a number") if the value passed to it cannot be converted to a number.

You need to filter these values out â€“ thankfully, arrays have a method specifically for this. The .filter() method will allow you to filter elements out of an array, creating a new array in the process.

Declare a filtered variable and assign numbers.filter() to it.*/



const calculate = () => {
  const value = document.querySelector("#numbers").value;
  const array = value.split(/,\s*/g);
  const numbers = array.map(el => Number(el));
  const filtered = numbers.filter();
}
