The ears should always be placed above the part of the head it overlaps. You can do this with the z-index property.

z-index is a property you can use to define the order of overlapping HTML elements. Any element with a higher z-index will always be positioned over an element with a lower z-index.

To see z-index in action, set the z-indexproperty of the left ear to -1.*/
