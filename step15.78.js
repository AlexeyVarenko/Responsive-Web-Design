/*Step 78
The equality operator == is used to check if two values are equal. To compare two values, you'd use a statement like value == 8.

Add an if statement to your loop. The statement should check if done is equal to count using the equality operator.*/



while (continueLoop) {
    done++;
   if(done==count){
     
   }
  }
