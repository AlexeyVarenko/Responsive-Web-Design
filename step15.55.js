/*Step 55
Because your function was no longer using the parameter, changing the value passed in the call did not affect it.

Go ahead and remove the test declaration from your padRow function. Also, remove the return statement, so your function is empty again.*/



function padRow() {

}
const call = padRow();
console.log(call);
