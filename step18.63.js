/*Step 63
Loop through the playlistSongElements with a forEach method.

The forEach method is used to loop through an array and perform a function on each element of the array. For example, suppose you have an array of numbers and you want to log each number to the console.

Example Code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using forEach to iterate through the array
numbers.forEach((number) => {
  console.log(number); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
});
Use the forEach method on playlistSongElements. Pass in songEl as the parameter and use arrow syntax to add in an empty callback.*/



playlistSongElements.forEach((songEl)=>{

});
