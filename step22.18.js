/*Step 18
Now that your function is set up, it's time to learn about binary numbers.

Binary numbers are a base-2 number system. Unlike the base-10 or decimal number system we use every day that uses 10 digits (0-9) to form numbers, the binary number system only has two digits, 0 and 1. In computer science, these binary digits are called bits, and are the smallest unit of data computers can process. For computers, 0 represents false or "off", and 1 represents true or "on".

In your decimalToBinary function, use the return keyword to return a string of the binary number representation of true.

Note: Binary numbers can be long sequences that start with 0, so they are often represented as strings.*/



return "1"
