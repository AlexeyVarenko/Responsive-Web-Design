/*Step 21
Now that you're familiar with binary numbers, it's time to finish building the function to do the conversion for you. You'll start off with a simpler solution first, then refactor that into a recursive solution.

First, you need to create some arrays to store the inputs and results of the division you'll do in the following steps. These will make it easier to see how the decimal to binary conversion works.

Remove the return statement from your decimalToBinary function. Then, declare variables named inputs, quotients, and remainders, and assign an empty array to each of them.*/



const inputs=[];
  const quotients=[];
  const remainders=[];
