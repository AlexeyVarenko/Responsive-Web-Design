/*Step 40
You will now start working on the cat's eyes. Like the ears, the eyes will have inner eyes.

Create a div element with the class cat-eyes. Inside the cat-eyes element, create two div elements with the class cat-left-eye and cat-right-eye respectively.*/


<div class="cat-eyes">
          <div class="cat-left-eye"></div>
          <div class="cat-right-eye"></div>
        </div>
