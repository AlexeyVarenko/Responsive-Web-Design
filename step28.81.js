/*Step 81
When you start the game, you will notice that the position of the platforms is animating alongside the player. But if you try to jump below one of the platforms, then you will jump right through it.

To fix this issue, you will need to add collision detection logic to the game.

Start by calling the forEach method on the platforms array. For the callback function pass in platform as the parameter.*/


platforms.forEach((platform)=>{})
