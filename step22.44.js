Awesome. Now you have a more efficient way to convert decimal numbers into binary. After learning a bit about the call stack and recursion, you'll refactor the decimalToBinary function to use recursion instead of a while loop.

Create a function named a that returns the following: "freeCodeCamp " + b().*/



const a=()=>{
    return ("freeCodeCamp " + b())
  }
