/*Step 55
Your final calculation is the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance.

Begin by declaring a getStandardDeviation function, with the array parameter. In the function body, declare a variance variable and assign it the variance of the array.*/



const getStandardDeviation = (array) => {
  const variance=getVariance(array);
