/*Step 10
Now it's time to add the logic to your loop that increments count appropriately.

Inside the loop, use a conditional statement to increment count by 1 if the variable word equals the variable match. Otherwise, leave the value of count unchanged.*/



function printCharacters(str) {
  for (const char of str) {
    console.log(char);
  }
}
printCharacters("hello");

function getMatchedWordCount(sentence, match) {
  let count = 0;
  
  for (const word of sentence) {
    if (word === match) {
      count++;
    }
    console.log(`Checking "${word}" against "${match}" | Running count: ${count}`);
  }
  
  return count;
}

console.log(
  getMatchedWordCount(
    ["I", "really", "really", "really", "like", "to", "code"],
