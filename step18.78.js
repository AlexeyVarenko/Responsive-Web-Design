/*Step 78
When the shuffle button is pressed, you want to set the currentSong to nothing and the songCurrentTime to 0.

Set userData.currentSong to null and userData.songCurrentTime to 0.

Note: You should not use optional chaining for this step because you are explicitly setting the currentSong and songCurrentTime properties to be null and 0 respectively.*/



userData.currentSong=null;
  userData.songCurrentTime=0;
