/*Step 49
Now it is time to test out the pause button.

Add a "click" event listener to the pauseButton element, then pass in pauseSong as the second argument of the event listener. This is the function the event listener will run.

Test out your app by first clicking on the play button followed by the pause button. You should see that everything is working as expected*/



pauseButton.addEventListener("click", pauseSong)
