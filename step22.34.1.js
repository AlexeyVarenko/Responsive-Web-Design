/*Step 34
Your decimalToBinary function works well, but there is an issue â€“ because of the condition in your while loop, it only works for numbers greater than 0. If you try to convert 0 to binary, nothing will get added to the page.

To fix this, add an if statement to check if input is equal to 0. Leave the body of the if statement empty for now.*/



if(input===0){
  
}
