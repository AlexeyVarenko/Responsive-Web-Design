/*Step 42
In previous steps you built out the functionality for playing a song. Now you need to add the functionality to the play button so that it will play the current song when it is clicked on.

Use the addEventListener() method and pass in a "click" event for the first argument and an empty callback function with arrow syntax for the second argument, e.g., () => {}.*/



playButton.addEventListener('click', () => {})
