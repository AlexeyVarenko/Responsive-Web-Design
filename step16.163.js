/*Step 163
After your numbers array, create a while loop that runs as long as numbers.length is less than 10.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with while loops like this:

Example Code
while (condition) {
  // code to run
}*/



function pick(guess) {
    const numbers = [];
    while (numbers.length<10) {
    
  }
  }
