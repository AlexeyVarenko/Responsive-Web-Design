/*Step 40
You need to update the current song being played as well as the appearance of the playButton element.

Assign song to the currentSong property on the userData object.

Note: You should not use the optional chaining operator ?. in this step because userData.currentSong will not be null or undefined at this point.*/


userData.currentSong=song;
