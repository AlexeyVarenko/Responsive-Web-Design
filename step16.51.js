/*Step 51
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Example Code
object.property;
Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read the name property of the developer object:

Example Code
const developer = {
  name: "Jessica",
}

// Output: Jessica
console.log(developer.name); 
Update your console statement to access the name property of the cat object using dot notation.

Open up the console to see the name of "Whiskers" logged to the console.*/



console.log(cat.name)
