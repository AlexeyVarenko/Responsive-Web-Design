/*Step 47
The variance of a series represents how much the data deviates from the mean, and can be used to determine how spread out the data are. The variance is calculated in a few steps.

Start by declaring a getVariance function that takes an array parameter. Within that function, declare a mean variable and assign it the value of the getMean function, passing array as the argument.*/




const getVariance = (array) => {
  const mean =getMean(array);
