/*Step 18
Because you need to compare elements, you'll need to use a nested for loop. This loop should iterate through every element in the array except the last one. Use j as your inner loop's iterator variable.*/



const bubbleSort = (array) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j=0; j<array.length -1;j++){
      
    }
  }
